 State disaster management minister Dinesh Chandra Yadav said that East Champaran DM has confirmed the deaths of 27 people. 

 Kotwa police station SHO Vijay Sinha told TOI that only four people could be rescued from the ill-fated bus. 

 “The injured have been rushed to the local hospital for treatment. They have suffered burn injuries,” the SHO said. 

 The SHO, quoting villagers and some eye witnesses, said that the accident took place when the driver attempted to save a two-wheeler. The bus belonged to a private operator, he said.

Ashes, recovered from the spot, would be sent for forensic examination to ascertain if those are human ashes. A team of forensic experts have been called at the spot for the purpose. 

 Officials said no remains of human body were found inside the bus. The vehicle has been pulled out of the roadside ditch.
