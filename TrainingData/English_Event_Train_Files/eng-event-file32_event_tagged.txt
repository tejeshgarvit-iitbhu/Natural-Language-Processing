 Rescue efforts ran through the night after the accident late Monday near Volgograd in southwest Russia - one of the cities hosting the World Cup football tournament opening this week. 

 &quot;The rescue operations have just finished. The last body has been recovered and the number of dead is 11,&quot; the local emergencies ministry said in a statement quoted by the Ria Novosti news agency. 

 At least 16 people were on the catarmaran, according to a statement from the Investigative Committee which has opened an investigation into possible breaches of safety regulations. 

 According to an unnamed source quoted by the TASS news agency, the catarmaran was built to take 12 people and was unlicensed. 

 Local media reported that the vessel was being driven by a former municipal official in Volgograd, who has been convicted in the past for various misdemeanours including hooliganism.
